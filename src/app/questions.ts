This yearly deductible is the same, no matter when you start. But if you wait until later in the year to sign up, you will have fewer months to pay off the same total amount. That can mean higher monthly payments.\n\nApplying Early vs. Applying Late\nApplying Early: You spread the deductible over more months.\nResult: Smaller monthly payments.\n\nApplying Late: You have the same total deductible, but fewer months to pay it off.\nResult: Bigger monthly payments.\n\nIf you enroll earlier in the year, your monthly costs will be lower, and it will be easier to manage your budget.",

To check if you have work insurance, review your employment contract, contact your HR department, or look for health benefits information on your employer's online portal.\n\nSchool Insurance:\nIf you are a student, your school may offer health insurance through a student association or union. Check your tuition statements or contact your school’s health services office to confirm if you have coverage and what it includes.\n\nOther Private Insurance:\nThis includes plans you or your family may have purchased independently, such as extended health plans or family insurance policies. To verify this, review your policy documents, check your insurance provider's website, or contact them directly.\n\nOnce you confirm your insurance coverage, provide the details in the relevant fields on the TDP application.

If the policyholder only has a single name, leave this field blank and check the box to the right.\n- Policy Holder Last Name or Single Name (Required): Enter the last name or single name of the policyholder as it appears on the insurance documentation.\n- Name of Insurance Company (Required): Provide the name of the private insurance company.\n- Policy or Plan Number (Required): Enter the policy or plan number, which can typically be found on the insurance card or documentation. The length of a policy number varies, though it's usually five to seven numbers in length.\n- Identification or Certificate Number (Optional): If applicable, enter the policyholder’s identification or certificate number. This field is not mandatory but can assist in processing your application. It is usually around 10 characters long.\n- Coverage Start Date (Optional): Enter the date the policy started, if visible on your insurance card, in the format YYYY/MM/DD. For example: 2022/07/23.\n- Coverage End Date (Optional): If the policy has a known end date, enter it in the same format YYYY/MM/DD.

Since this plan only covers one person, select the policyholder’s name.\n\nIf You Have Coverage Through Another Individual\nIf you have coverage through another individual, you can add that coverage too. Make sure that the name of the policy holder matches the name on the insurance card. For persons covered, if you are covered under someone else's policy, list that individual as the policy holder.

Your answers will help determine eligibility for credits or additional coverage.

(Required)\nA premium is the amount you pay to maintain your private insurance plan. This could be a monthly, yearly, or one-time payment and may be deducted directly from your paycheck if provided through an employer. If you pay a premium, select ‘Yes’. You may qualify for a credit of up to $200 toward your TDP deductible, depending on the amount paid and the number of household members covered by your plan. If you select ‘Yes’ the application will ask you what your annual premium paid is, though this field is optional. If you do not pay for your insurance (e.g., it is fully covered by your employer or another entity), select ‘No’.\n\nDid anyone in your insurance plan reach their annual or lifetime maximum coverage? (Required)\nThis refers to whether anyone in your household covered under the plan has reached the maximum dollar amount the insurance company will pay for prescription drugs within a year (annual limit) or over a lifetime (lifetime limit). If someone in your household has reached these limits, select ‘Yes’ to indicate that TDP assistance is required. Otherwise, select ‘No’.\n\nIs there a particular drug that you wish to claim with TDP that your drug plan does not cover (drug exclusions)? (Required)\nIf your private insurance plan excludes coverage for a specific drug that you need and wish to claim under the TDP, select ‘Yes’. If all required medications are already covered by your private insurance, select ‘No’.\n\nTo expedite your application, upload the required private insurance documents, such as:\n- A letter from your insurer confirming the date a drug maximum was reached and the reinstatement date.\n- A letter stating which drug or DIN is not covered by your plan.\nIf available, upload these documents now at the bottom of Page 3.

This yearly deductible is the same, no matter when you start. But if you wait until later in the year to sign up, you will have fewer months to pay off the same total amount. That can mean higher monthly payments.\n\nApplying Early vs. Applying Late\n- Applying Early: You spread the deductible over more months. Result: Smaller monthly payments.\n- Applying Late: You have the same total deductible, but fewer months to pay it off. Result: Bigger monthly payments.\n\nIf you enroll earlier in the year, your monthly costs will be lower, and it will be easier to manage your budget.",
